Hi, my name is Jomin Joseph and I am pursuing new opportunities where I can develop my skills and gain more hands on experience.
I have included some of my previous projects within my github. 

My repositories consist of:

Online Pong Game: This is an online game which I created using SQL, PHP, and HTML. Data is stored within an online datbase 
and retrieved when neccesary to log in and check previous scores.
 
 
 
Compiler: This is a basic language compiler coded in C++. It is composed of a lexical analyzer, parser, and interpreter 
in C++ to compile print statements, logical statements, and mathematical equations. The read.me files contain the rules 
for this basic language.



HTTPRequest: This imitates the process of an HTTP request through the use of TCP sockets. There is a HTTPserver and
HTTP client. 




DNSServer: THis imitates the process of pinigng a DNS Server. It either accepts or denies the particular 
request and more information is found in the read.me file. There is both a DNSServer and DNSClient. This program 
was created by utilizing UDP sockets.
